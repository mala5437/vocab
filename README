Here I gather some vocabulary from books I've read.
Each directoryname stands for a language pair.
I use the following conventions:
de:	German
fr:	French
en:	English
nl: 	Dutch
sw:	Swedish
it:	Italian
es:	Spanish

The vocablists are named <BOOK>.txt and kept in a simple text format. 
I use a semicolon ';' (usually followed by one or several TABs) as seperator between the two columns.
